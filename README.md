### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am El Houssain Souhail aka Ductive / Ductive99

##### About me
I have been fascinated by science and tech since a very young age, I have always been and continue to be deeply curious about the how things work, constantly seeking to understand how they operate and striving to replicate, enhance, or even create something new.

I could say that say that I'm not super proud of the amount nor the quality of work I have done, but I believe in myself and I have the will to learn and improve to hopefully create value in this world.

While I may not be particularly proud of the quantity or quality of work I have accomplished thus far, I strongly believe in my own abilities and determination to continuously learn and grow. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact and contribute value to the world.

My best regards.
